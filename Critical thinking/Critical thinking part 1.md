- The art of reasoning

## 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Understanding reasoning
- How to identify an argument
- To think critically is to ask the following questions: why is this statement so, and how did the statement come to be this? 
- A good argument contains both reasoning and a conclusion
- The easiest way to identify an argument is by first finding the conclusions in the statement.
- Identifying reasoning can be done by finding the following example words or phrases: because, since, in view of, as ...
- Sometimes, identifying reasoning might be missing a conjunction word or a phrase. An example is when reasoning is presented at the beginning or end of a statement.
- Identifying a conclusion can be done by searching for the following words or phrases in a statement: Thus, therefore, assert, must be and more.
- Similar to reasoning, when searching for a conclusion in a statement, it may be missing an identifying word, especially if the conclusion begins at the start of the statement.
- An assertion is a conclusive statement without reasoning. 
- An assertion can be in the following forms: beliefs, opinions, or neutral facts.
